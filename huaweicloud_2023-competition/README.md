### Project Overview:

The cloud-based ranking algorithm utilizes `yolov5 + Openvino + Huawei Cloud ModelArts`. It employs binary search and divide-and-conquer algorithms for optimization, allowing for the detection of fatigue states' start and end times without traversing the entire video.

The edge-side (`Jetson TX2 NX`) algorithm uses `Deepstream (C/C++ 6.0.1) + yolov5`. Specific implementation codes include:

- [On-the-Air Model Update](https://docs.nvidia.com/metropolis/deepstream/6.0.1/dev-guide/text/DS_on_the_fly_model.html)
- [Smart Video Record](https://docs.nvidia.com/metropolis/deepstream/6.0.1/dev-guide/text/DS_Smart_video.html)

These implementations are in `C/C++`, as the Python implementation, according to NVIDIA, is currently unfeasible.

Refer to the technical documentation in this directory for detailed implementation.
